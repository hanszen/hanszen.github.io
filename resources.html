                        to proofread your paper for free, or just want some help with homework/studying for 
                        tests, come visit your Academic Mentors! The Mentors are a group of friendly Hanszenites who

                    <p class="text-justfiy">
                        Divisional advisors consist of several Hanszen associates and Rice faculty who graciously 
                        volunteer their time to help you choose your classes and answer any questions you might have about certain majors. 
                        Most of these advisors specialize in a certain school (School of Engineering, School of Humanities, etc.). 
                        During O-Week, you'll have a chance to meet them to go over your planned schedule for the fall, and even 
                        during the school year, they will be available (usually by appointment) to help you with class or major 
                        decisions. (Note that after you declare a major, you'll be assigned a major advisor, which is an advisor 
                        from your department). Make good friends with these wonderful professors! They love to help you find your 
                        interests and succeed here at Rice, and are a great resource to have available.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) consist of your fellow Hanszenites who have been trained 
                        by the Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
                        assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically related. 
                        In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the form of academic 
                        planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose classes for the next term. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During O-Week, four Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming students narrow down which courses 
                        they want to take and create their fall schedule. Once the school year starts, about twenty Hanszen PAAs 
                        will be available to answer questions about deadlines, registration, rules, and any other academic questions. 
                        They really are here to help you, so if you have any questions or just need solid academic advice, feel free 
                        to knock on their doors or send them an email. If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can.

                        The goals of the STRIVE Liaisons are to raise awareness within the college about the issue 
                        of sexual assault and to prepare Hanszenites with the tools they need to become allies and prevent sexual assault 
                        in the future. They work with the Title IX office on campus to understand the intricacies of the issue as it pertains 
                        to college campuses and Rice in particular. They also serve as confidential resources to listen to Hanszenites and, 
                        if requested, connect them to other resources at Rice and/or off campus in Houston that will support them and help 
                        them report incidences of sexual assault if they so choose.
