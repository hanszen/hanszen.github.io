                        One of the most important parts of Hanszen is our committees. They are basically like small clubs that are allotted their own yearly budget,
                        and mostly serve to either buy things for the college or to put on events for Hanszenites.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="light">Standing Committees</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hanszen's Standing Committees are designated by our Constitution as essential to the functioning of the college,
                        and thus are automatically renewed each year. It is because of the hard work of Standing Committees that we have things like Beer Bike,
                        Associates, Hanszen sports teams, and awesome swag. If you want to get involved or have any questions/ideas for events, feel free to
                        find or email the committee heads below! You can also email Emery Engling, Hanszen IVP for any committee-related questions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="light">Initiative Committees</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Imagine getting Hanszen funding to share your hobbies, interests, and passions with the college-- this is what Initiative Committees are!
                        This committee system, started in 2014, allows Hanszenites to get involved doing the things they love most. Initiative committees have included
                        things like arts and crafts, hacking, and brewing. Check out this year's Initiative Committees below, and feel free to get in touch if you want
                        to get involved. Otherwise, start thinking of your own ideas for an Initiative Committee (or check out some past Initiatives to bring back) and
                        watch for applications in the spring!
