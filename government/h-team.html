        <p>
            The H-Team is our dedicated team of adults and their families who live at Hanszen and who provide endless wisdom and resources to all Hanszenites.
            They include the Magisters, whose house is by Old Section and the grove, three sets of Resident Associates (RAs) spread across Old Section and New Section,
            and a College Coordinator with her office in the Commons. Their job is to make sure Hanszen is running properly, throw excellent study breaks,
            and serve as mentors for Hanszenites to support us through the highs and lows of college life.

                        My name is Joyce and I am the Hanszen College Coordinator. I have been at Hanszen for 17 years and at Rice for 25 years. 
                        I assist the Magisters with the day to day administration of Hanszen. 
                        I also support and advise students on a myriad of issues, working closely with our executive Cabinet with budgeting, purchasing, housing, and event planning.

                        Students are the heart of Hanszen and should not hesitate to come to me anytime to ask for life advice, rant about a class, 
                        figure out how to approach a difficult situation, to gain a different perspective, or just to have some candy.

                        I was born and raised in Texas, attending the Bradford School of Business. 
                        I am married to my high school sweetheart and we have 3 sons, 2 beautiful daughters-in-law, 4 grandchildren with another on the way, and 2 fur babies. 
                        When we are not with our family, my husband and I love to travel, garden, and preserve our own food.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hi Hanszen!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        We are Lauren Stadler and Jonathan (Jon) Fombonne, your new magisters! We are so excited
                        to build on the legacy of past Hanszen magisters, including the incomparable Fabiola and
                        Carlos. We met over 20 years ago as undergrads at Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, and
                        have been together ever since. Lauren is originally from just outside Boston, with strong family
                        ties to Maine, where we got married and visit every summer. Jon grew up in France and
                        England (he’s half French) and came to the US for college. While we never thought we’d end
                        up in Texas, Rice came calling for Lauren and we’ve now lived here over nine years (longest
                        place Jon has ever lived!). Since we moved here, we’ve added three kids to our family: Oscar
                        (7)–who goes by Ozzie–Freya (5), and Sidney (3 almost 4). And then there’s Noodle, our
                        friendly one-eyed boxer mix. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Lauren is an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. After earning her B.S.
                        in engineering, she worked as a systems engineer for a large firm in Washington D.C., and then
                        joined a small startup in Berkeley, CA. The startup, where she designed algae-based
                        wastewater treatment systems, was her first introduction to environmental engineering, and
                        specifically wastewater engineering, and she was hooked. She did a Fulbright in India for a year
                        where she studied nutrient removal from wastewater using algae before pursuing her Ph.D. in
                        environmental engineering at the University of Michigan. At Michigan, Lauren discovered her
                        passion for research that protects human and environmental health. Lauren’s research group at
                        Rice focuses on wastewater microbiology. They research wastewater-based epidemiology,
                        environmental biotechnologies, and environmental synthetic biology. Lauren’s work stretches
                        beyond the boundaries of Rice’s campus, and she collaborates closely with the City of
                        Houston’s Public Health department to track infectious diseases in wastewater and inform the
                        City’s public health response. In her spare time, Lauren loves to spend time with her family, play
                        games, exercise, and read (or listen) to books and talk about them with her friends.

                        Jon is an attorney, currently working as the First Assistant in the Harris County Attorney’s
                        Office. He received his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School, and was a civil
                        litigator in private practice prior to taking his current jon. Before attending law school Jon worked
                        as a chef in fine dining restaurants. He still loves to cook, even if his current audience tends to
                        prefer buttered pasta and chicken nuggets. In particular, he likes to work with doughs–breads
                        and pastas–as a way to keep one foot in the culinary world. Jon plays music when he can
                        (piano and guitar), and would love to jam with Hanszenites. He is also involved in local politics
                        and serves on various nonprofit boards, including the Houston Parks Board. He is passionate
                        about making Houston more livable by creating better public spaces. And if you can’t get a hold
                        of him, it’s probably because he’s watching his beloved Arsenal Football Club.

                        Ozzie is starting second grade and can’t wait to get to Hanszen and talk to all the students. He’s
                        an old soul in a little body, and often has his head buried in a book (especially to learn new facts
                        he can test you on). When he grows up, he wants to be a scientist, like his mom. He loves
                        playing cards and chess, enjoys soccer, and is looking forward to starting piano lessons. He’s

                        also a performer – he loves the stage, whether it’s to dance, give a school speech, or act. We
                        don’t know where he gets that confidence from.

                        Freya is starting kindergarten and is a bundle of joy. Her energy is infectious and she often has
                        older kids and adults wrapped around her little finger. Since she was very little, she has been an
                        astute observer of human behavior and uses that to her advantage–mostly for good. She loves
                        dancing, singing (and knows the lyrics to songs she probably shouldn’t know), drawing, and
                        playing field hockey and soccer. She’s our most adventurous eater (low bar) and even eats
                        salmon skin! More than anything, she loves her friends and would play all day if she could.

                        Sidney is a natural comedian and is always looking for a laugh. She can contort her face into
                        the most hilarious expressions. She’s the loudest of our kids, so you’ll definitely hear her
                        coming. She adores her siblings and can’t wait to join them in elementary school. Like her
                        sister, Sidney loves drawing and is learning to write. If you can’t see her, listen for the little voice
                        singing “Savage Love” by Jason Derulo in near perfect pitch.

                        Finally, Noodle is actually our oldest “child.” While she sometimes takes a backseat to the kids,
                        she never lets us forget she’s around. She is really into greeting new people (sometimes too
                        forcefully) and will be your best friend if you show her some love or take her for a walk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        As we are originally from outside Houston, we love to travel and visit family and friends around
                        the country and the world. We also spend a lot of time exploring Houston’s dining options,
                        whether in Chinatown, off the beaten path taco trucks, or our favorite higher end places
                        (Nancy’s Hustle and Tiny Champions, among many others). We have become avid tennis
                        players and take lessons once a week. We also love the outdoors when we can get there,
                        especially hiking and skiing. Ozzie and Freya love to ride their bikes, and we hope to make
                        more use of our bikes as a family now that we’re on campus. We’re excited to embark on this
                        magister journey and to welcome all of the Hanszenites to our new home.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hey Hanszen! We are Bryn and Neal Dugre, your Old Section RAs! We met the first few weeks of college at our alma mater, Elon University. 
                        We've been married for twelve years and have been Houstonians for eight. We have a five year-old daughter, Georgina, and a one year-old,
                        Ambrose, aka the youngest Hanszenite.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Bryn grew up in rural Virginia and is a bona fide debutante. Send any etiquette questions her way. At Elon she majored in two English concentrations:
                        Creative Writing and Literature. Her passion for English contributes to her love of reading and her Instagram captions. Bryn has been the Operations
                        Administrator in the Earth, Environmental & Planetary Sciences (EEPS) department at Rice for four years, working with the chair on special projects
                        and as event planner extraordinaire for all EEPS department events. She listens to a lot of podcasts and is currently working her way through Armchair
                        Expert and Wait, Wait... Don't Tell me. You'll likely see her walking around campus with headphones trying to catch the latest episode.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Neal also hails from the East Coast: Massachusetts (the best of all the commonwealths, however much Bryn would beg to differ).
                        Neal is an Assistant Professor of Early American History at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate courses
                        on U.S. history, American Indian history, and all aspects of the colonial period. Unsurprisingly, his research focuses on seventeenth-century New England,
                        which is to say that he knows more than you will ever want to know about the puritans. Whereas most normal children grow up watching cartoons or sports,
                        Neal grew up watching cooking shows on his local PBS station. The silver-lining of this unusual upbringing is that he is now an excellent cook and baker,
                        skills you will no doubt benefit from during your time at Hanszen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">As an honorary Beer Bike team member-in-training, Georgina loves riding her tricycle around campus. She loves to read books,
                        sing, the pool, and showing you her stuffed animal friends. You will probably see her running around the quad or commons saying hi to all her friends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Ambrose loves to move and loves food. He started walking at 11 months, and we can't slow him down. He's generous with his smiles,
                        chews on everything, and loves people. You will probably hear him before you see him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">We look forward to hosting weekly study breaks and plan to make lots of goodies to feed hungry Hanszenites. We live in Old Section,
                        apartment 105. Please stop by and say hello. We can't wait to meet you!

                   <h3 class="light">Mariel Cano & Ben Batista</h3>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        The Batista-Cano family is thrilled to be part of the Hanszen College community! Ben is a physician-
                        scientist at MD Anderson, where he works in clinical research, and Mariel is a sociologist who has
                        dedicated her career to higher education. She currently serves as the Career Development Office
                        Operations and Administrator at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        Ben and Mariel share a unique story: both were born and raised in Chihuahua, Mexico, and attended the
                        same schools from elementary through high school — but their lives didn’t cross paths until years later.
                        While Ben was living in New York and Mariel was pursuing her master’s in El Paso, Texas, fate finally
                        brought them together. They became fast friends, then best friends, and within two years, they were
                        married. This summer, they celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary and are now proud parents to
                        their joyful 9-month-old son, Santiago, who joined the family in September 2024.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        Ben and Mariel moved to Houston as newlyweds in 2021 and have since planted strong roots in the city.
                        They’ve been embraced by a warm and welcoming community and are excited to extend that same
                        hospitality to every Hanszenite. As they like to say, “Every Hanszenite is going to steal a piece of our
                        heart”, but don’t worry, they’ve got a big one to share!
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        Ben is a runner who enjoys long runs with his favorite playlists. If there’s a marathon or half-marathon
                        nearby, he’s probably already training for it. Ben’s passionate about Soccer and also a huge sports
                        enthusiast, so if you’re ever up for a game, Ben’s your guy! Mariel, on the other hand, is more likely to
                        be found exploring new coffee shops, pastry spots, or enjoying the arts. She loves music and dancing,
                        and while she may not claim to be a great singer, she’ll sing her heart out just to make someone smile.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        Santiago is a bundle of joy who loves music, peek-a-boo, clapping, and crawling into every new corner
                        he can find. He’s a big fan of splashing in the tub or pool, and his favorite colors are blue and yellow
                        (Hanszen colors, of course!). Get ready for lots of love and plenty of cuddles from the smallest
                        Hanszenite!
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        And let’s not forget about Bolt, their 10-year-old French Bulldog who may or may not have Hulk blood in
                        his veins, since he’s definitely not your average-sized Frenchie! Bolt is a sweet, four-legged friend who
                        loves walks and squirrel-watching and will be the first to greet you at the door.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                        You’ll find the Batista-Cano family on the top floor of New Hanszen. Their door is always
                        open “mi casa es su casa”, and they can’t wait to welcome you in. Whether it’s a study break, a coffee
                        run, or a game of pick-up soccer, they’re excited to be your RAs and part of your Rice journey!

                    <h3 class="light">Lam and Rebecca Yu</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hello Hanszen! We are Lam and Rebecca Yu, your friendly neighborhood RFAs. 
                        Lam was born in China and grew up in Houston. Rebecca is a more recent transplant to the Lone Star State, having lived here for the past eleven years. 
                        Rebecca grew up outside of Nashville and then Atlanta but returned to Nashville to study music at Vanderbilt for her undergrad. 
                        They met and then married in Memphis. When Rebecca was seven months pregnant with their first child, Catherine, they and Tuck, their faithful puppy, moved to Houston. 
                        A decade later, Tuck is still our puppy, but Catherine is a big sister with two brothers, Joshua (8 years old) and Samuel (4 years old).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Lam is an Associate Teaching Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. 
                        He mainly teaches introductory physics classes for science and engineering majors. 
                        He loves teaching physics. To him, physics is breathtakingly beautiful. 
                        He believes physics is one way for us to face the infinite without being overwhelmed. 
                        Lam hopes everyone can be persuaded that physics is not an intimidating subject filled with incomprehensible formulas that only a selected few can understand but a thing of beauty that is approachable and enjoyable. 
                        In his free time, Lam likes building and fixing things and enjoys reading and learning to play the piano (still a work in progress). 
                        His favorite author is Marilynne Robinson.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Rebecca is a violinist. This job title essentially means that she freelances and teaches. 
                        Being a musician has allowed Rebecca to travel and perform with people from around the globe. 
                        She has taught students ranging in ages from three to sixty-three, music courses for college undergraduates and preschoolers, and loves that despite different ages and backgrounds, there is always a way to connect with each other. 
                        She has played events ranging from wedding proposals to weddings; small dinner parties to shows in full costume involving pyrotechnics and aerialists. 
                        In her free time, Rebecca loves reading and learning to play new instruments, as well as learning German and  Cantonese. 
                        She has also recently taken up running (also a struggle, but like learning a new language, the good kind of struggle) and ran her first Half Marathon when Samuel was four months old. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Catherine is 11 years old and has always had a natural joy and love of learning. She is a loving big sister and takes great care of her brothers. 
                        She delights in making new friends, creating art, and being outside. 
                        Catherine loves to go camping (especially the s'mores) and has helped to instill that love in her little brothers. 
                        Since she was three, Catherine has wanted to be an astronaut and go to Mars when she grows up. She loves being on campus and hopes to attend Rice. 
                        She has studied violin at the Michael P. Hammond Preparatory School at the Shepherd School of Music for seven years and plays with the Houston Youth String Orchestra. 
                        She loves to read and write and, more often than not, will have either her head in a book or a pen in her hand.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Eight-year-old Joshua is a big Harry Potter fan and cannot wait until he turns eleven. 
                        He has big plans for when he arrives at Hogwarts, but for now, he says Hanszen is his Hogwarts. 
                        Joshua plays the piano and little league baseball and would stay outside to play baseball all day if he could.  
                        Joshua has a kind heart and is a deep thinker. He loves to be silly just to make us laugh and is a great brother. 
                        Joshua has always loved to learn and loves reading. He also enjoys conducting science experiments and always has a variety of seeds growing, rocks tumbling, or concoctions mixing. 
                        He loves playing and watching baseball and wants to play for the Astros when he grows up (after Hogwarts, that is).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Samuel recently turned four years old, and he loves to do whatever his big brother and sister are doing. 
                        He is very inquisitive, loves to listen and dance to music, and gives Tuck treats. 
                        Samuel loves to play any musical instrument he can get his hands on and has told us he would like to play the cello. 
                        Samuel also enjoys playing outside and finding animals and insects. 
                        Samuel loves to help bake treats, and you just might find him around Commons with a basket full of freshly baked cookies that he wants to share. 
                        He loves to pull a book off the shelf, climb into a reading nook, and read like Catherine and Joshua. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The oldest of the Yu children, fourteen-year-old Tuck, is passionate about you. 
                        He hasn't even met you yet, but he already loves you. Just like Ariel from the little mermaid, Tuck wants to be where the people are. 
                        He is the happiest when he is with us, and he takes good care of us. 
                        If it storms at night, he will pace between everyone's rooms until it stops, or sometimes he will knock the door open so that he can lay in front of Samuel's crib. 
                        He loves to take walks, meets new people and animals, and is highly interested in squirrels, birds, and UPS delivery people. 
                        He eagerly anticipates mealtimes with Samuel because he knows the youngest Yu will always give him a snack. 
                        Tuck's life goals include learning how to climb trees (squirrel motivated), sleeping in bed with Catherine, Joshua, and Samuel, and convincing us to let him have a seat at the dinner table.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        We enjoy watching movies and tv shows, camping, cooking, baking, and learning about different cultures. 
                        We can't wait to host study breaks and share our passions (and food!) with Hanszenites. We live on the first floor of the New Section.  
                        Please come by any time and see us and say hello. Welcome to the Hanszen Family!
