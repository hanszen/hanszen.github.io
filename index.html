  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">
    <div class="modal-content p-4" style="background-color: black; color: white;">
      <p>
        Over the past few months, the issue of police brutality towards Black individuals, such as George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor,
        has come to the forefront of mainstream discourse, despite the pervasive presence of anti-Blackness throughout United States history.
        Even though George Floyd's murder in May was not the first instance of violence towards Black folx, the horrific 8 minutes and 46 seconds
        of his life caught on camera gripped us all and highlighted the extent to which Black lives are disregarded and dehumanized.
        Protests have erupted across the nation and around the world to demand justice for victims of police brutality. These protests echo the years of work
        by Black activists pushing to dismantle systems of anti-Blackness, as anti-Black racism occurs on many institutional levels, including our criminal justice system,
        our neighborhoods, our hospitals, and our schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the lack of an official statement from the Rice administration, we would like to make it abundantly clear that, as a Hanszen community,
        we strive to create an environment that celebrates diversity, promotes inclusion, and not only encourages but expects antiracism. This past summer,
        several members of Hanszen leadership have been working to make Hanszen a safer space for all, including drafting a Code of Conduct that details
        consequences for any act of hate speech committed by a member of the Hanszen community. Our commitment to an inclusive environment requires acknowledging
        that racism is a systemic issue that exists not only outside our space, but within it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        To our Black Hanszenites, we want to extend our wholehearted support to you and your families. Hanszen values and celebrates students from all walks of life
        and works adamantly to ensure that you feel not just welcome, but also appreciated. We acknowledge the emotional strain that this injustice and the others
        preceding and following it have caused you, and we hope that during these arduous times, you are still finding joy and support. Know that you have a place on campus
        and at Hanszen. It's our responsibility to make this college a place where all students feel comfortable and safe being themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to our non-Black Hanszenites, please continue to do the work of being an ally at all times, even if it's not trendy or convenient. As the Family College,
        it's our duty to make Hanszen a home for people of all backgrounds, and you can begin to do so by committing to being an active, vigilant ally. Educate yourself
        by engaging with Black media (watching films and reading books), support Black businesses, amplify Black voices, donate to Black-led organizations, sign petitions
        to demand justice, and find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BkbPEdAuDS0brRYgEkS9nfIsk-NgNMuIXc6cyXva1A" target="_blank">other ways</a>
        to uplift the Black community. As members of the Houston community, you should stay informed about the issues that affect Black Houstonians and support their advocacy efforts.
        At the end of the day, having a Hanszen Family Heart means that you show up for and support the Black community, here at Rice and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        To our incoming Hanszenites, we want to emphasize our excitement for your arrival on campus as well as the advising team's commitment to making O-Week as inclusive as possible.
        When you arrive on campus, many things may be unfamiliar, and you may be coming from a community that is different from Rice's. O-Week is a time to challenge yourself and to expand your boundaries.
        Take the opportunity to meet people from all backgrounds and to get to know them and their experiences. We hope that your journey in becoming a lifelong ally begins here,
        and that you rise to the occasion and play your part in fostering an inclusive community no matter where you are, whether that's at Hanszen, at Rice, or beyond.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        As always, the Diversity Facilitators and Diversity Committee Heads are available as yearlong resources for any issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion,
        so please do not hesitate to reach out to any of us. We urge all Hanszenites to call out injustice in all forms and to listen to and support the Black community.

<!--TotorO-Week Mission Statement-->

        TotorO-Week 2023 seeks to provide New Students with a warm and welcoming community that they can call home, both at Hanszen and in the larger Rice community. 
        With films like âPrincess Mononoke", âSpirited Away", and âMy Neighbor Totoro", Studio Ghibli brings a dreamlike world of poetic stories to life. 
        Hanszenâs plot is characterized by the diversity of brilliant minds and unique identities amongst our community, akin to the myriad of mythical creatures within the Studio Ghibli universe that frame a bright and colorful world. 
        We aim to foster an environment of care that supports all backgrounds and experiences and helps New Students find their role amidst their fellow Hanszenites. 
        We will support New Students as they fly to their dreams like Kiki in Kikiâs Delivery Service, devote themselves to their passions like Shizuku in Whisper of the Heart, and make new friends like Mei and Totoro in My Neighbor Totoro. 
        From our Advising Team and H-Team, we hope that students can find a safe, supporting, and open environment to show off their true character and nurture their physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. 
        To our newest Hanszenites, we aspire that the spirit of the Hanszen Family Heart can help guide you in your journey.
