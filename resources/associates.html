    The Associates Program, a staple of Rice culture, provides Hanszenites a community of faculty, staff, alumni, and community members to support them in their intellectual, cultural and social lives through mentorship, guidance and support. Our associates welcome students during O-Week, engage in events with students throughout the year, and make themselves available for students to reach out to. 
    <br>
    If you are a Hanszenite interested in connecting with an Associate, you are welcome to contact them directly using the information below. You may also contact the Associate committee heads to help connect you with more associates that are not listed here. 
    <br>
    If you are interested in becoming an Associate at Hanszen, email Joyce (<a href="mailto:joyce@rice.edu">joyce@rice.edu</a>), our College Coordinator.

At Rice where I've been since 2016, I work as a Lecturer in German for the Center for Languages and Intercultural Communication (CLIC). My students mostly know me as "Frau Baig", which means "Ms. Baig" in German. I love working with and teaching Rice students. I've been teaching since 2001 and still today, learning together with young people is one of my greatest passions. I'd love to see some of you in my future classes!</p>

                I teach the history of US foreign policy, US history, and modern Middle Eastern history. I also enjoy cooking, traveling, and rooting for my favorite sports teams including (in addition to the Rice Owls) the Astros, the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Hanszenites are always welcome in my classes!

I am a Venezuelan-Houstonian mother of four (boy, girl, boy, boy) and systems engineer. My husband and I decided to change our family's lives and the six of us moved from Caracas to Houston in 2001. As art collectors (a.k.a. our other children) we were fortunate to arrive in Houston, and be introduced to the MFAH at the time when its Latin American Art Department was launched. We immediately joined in the fun which turned out to be an amazing path. As immigrants we've had an aventurous journey, learning, enjoying and participating with different communities. We've made new friendships in the process. We've been fortunate to stay in touch with dear friends and family back in Venezuela (thanks to technological advances, social media and smartphones). As a parent I have been introduced to another world "literally" because my children grew up in a different country. I turned into the student I never was thanks to my children who I credit as the four greatest and very influential teachers of my life. In that spirit I hope to be of service to the Hanszen community.</p>

We're both giant board game fans with a healthy collection that we love to sharing. Having been with Hanszen theatre all 4 years, we're fans of all kinds of art like visiting museums, going to the movies, or watching a musical.

              <p class="card-text mb-0">Hello! My name is Angela Masciale and I graduated from Rice University in 2016 with a BA in Political Science. I like to say I've been a Hanszenite since I was 13 years old when my sister matriculated in Fall 2007. During my time at Rice, I served in various positions in student government at Hanszen (New Student Rep, Social, External VP, and President) and as part of the Student Admissions Council (Prospee Host, Tour Guide, and Senior Interviewer). After graduating in May 2016, I joined Deloitte Consulting and did Human Capital work for about four years. In August 2020, I became a student all over again to get my MBA at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business. I graduated in May 2022 and now work as a People Strategist at Neiman Marcus Group. I'm so happy to be back in Houston and would love to be of help in any and all regards: advice, connections, sponsorship, etc. 
                Both my older sisters were Hanszenites and contributed in different ways to Hanszen and the university at large. My oldest sister, Marina Masciale, was Rice-Baylor and is a practicing Pediatric Hospitalist at Texas Childrens. My other older sister, Theresa Masciale, was an editor at The Thresher and now is a manager at OpenStax (non-proft owned by Rice). So even if you have nothing to do with Poli Sci, or consulting - I'm happy to make the connection to those I know who have majored or been involved in other aspects at Rice!</p>

I received my PhD here at Rice in May 2023 and am excited to stay part of the Rice Community. I live here in Houston with my husband, Foster, my son, Wesley, and our dog, Lacie. The courses I teach are all methods courses, giving students the skills to be able to use data to learn more about the world and evaluate policies. As a scholar, my interests focus on international judicial politics, the institutional design of international organizations, and the use of a variety of data, specifically text and images, in the field of political science.  I am an avid card player, and I enjoy college football (Texas A&M undergrad so Gig'em!). We recently became season ticket holders to Rice football games, so if you see me at a game, please say hi! I look forward to getting to know more of the Hanszen community over lunches and at events!</p>

I lived in Old Section and while at Rice I spent a lot of time in the Weenie Loft where I met some of my closest friends who I still keep in touch with! Today I’m a project manager working in tech and living in Austin. When I'm not working I'm usually designing/making something - I took Architecture for Non-architects my senior year in the architecture school and went to graduate school for material culture and built environments. 
                Ever since graduating I’ve been involved with Rice alumni groups in whichever city I’ve lived in as well as volunteerism for the university. Currently I am on the ARA Board which represents the voices of all Rice alumni. I'm very excited to help continue to engender the environment that was so special for me during my time at Hanszen and Rice. HFH!</p>

Originally from Mexico, I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Visualization and a minor in Mathematics. After working at a marketing firm and a higher education institution, I realized I enjoyed working with students and helping them achieve their dreams and goals. I started working at Rice University as Assistant Director of Student Run Businesses(SRBs) and Marketing in February 2017. Although I am not longer in charge of the marketing, I still enjoy doing freelance for friends and family in my free time. What I love the most about working as an advisor for our SRBs is to see the growth and development each SRB achieves every year. I am currently working on getting my Master's in Higher Education from the University of Houston. Her passions are graphic design, photography, movies, karaoke, boba, live music, zumba, and gaming (especially anything League of Legends related). Cristy is expressive, motivated, creative, and open-minded.</p>
