                    <h2>Divisional Advisors</h2>

                    <p class="text-justfiy">
                        Divisional advisors consist of several Hanszen associates and Rice faculty who graciously 
                        volunteer their time to help you choose your classes and answer any questions you might have about certain majors. 
                        Most of these advisors specialize in a certain school (School of Engineering, School of Humanities, etc.). 
                        During O-Week, you'll have a chance to meet them to go over your planned schedule for the fall, and even 
                        during the school year, they will be available (usually by appointment) to help you with class or major 
                        decisions. (Note that after you declare a major, you'll be assigned a major advisor, which is an advisor 
                        from your department). Make good friends with these wonderful professors! They love to help you find your 
                        interests and succeed here at Rice, and are a great resource to have available.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) consist of your fellow Hanszenites who have been trained 
                        by the Office of Academic Advising (OAA) to help you choose classes, clarify academic rules and regulations, 
                        assist in finding research opportunities and study abroad information, and anything else academically related. 
                        In addition, the PAAs also facilitate a number of academic events at Hanszen, usually in the form of academic 
                        planning sessions, where Hanszenites come together and help each other choose classes for the next term. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During O-Week, four Hanszen PAAs will be present to help the incoming students narrow down which courses 
                        they want to take and create their fall schedule. Once the school year starts, about twenty Hanszen PAAs 
                        will be available to answer questions about deadlines, registration, rules, and any other academic questions. 
                        They really are here to help you, so if you have any questions or just need solid academic advice, feel free 
                        to knock on their doors or send them an email. If they can't find an answer for you, they'll find someone who can.
