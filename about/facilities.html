                            Hanszen may have once been the laughingstock of the residential colleges for our poor facilities, but that is a thing of the past.
                            We have a historic and well-maintained dorm in Old Section, a brand new dorm building in New Section, and the best commons of any college.
                            See the tabs on the left for a deeper dive into Hanszen's spaces.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hanszen Commons consists of two parts: Lower Commons and Upper Commons. Lower Commons has the entrance to South Servery, as well as a multitude of tables
                        so that you can eat meals, catch up, debate whatever's on your mind, and/or joke with your fellow Hanszenites. It also includes Joyce's office, a kitchen,
                        and a laundry room. It's here that Hanszenites will make announcements about events during meal times. Lower Commons even has a grand piano for your mealtime
                        serenading desires, or for plinking out "Row Row Row Your Boat" late at night when you think no one's listening.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Upper Commons consists of a large open area with couches and numerous smaller rooms. You'll probably visit the open area at least once a week for
                        Hanszen Cabinet meetings. Also in Upper Commons there is a game room with pool, foosball, and poker tables, several nice study rooms, a music room,
                        a private dining room, and Hanszen's own library.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="light">Old Section</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hanszen Old Section is so named because it is the oldest part of Hanszen. Built in 1916 as South Hall, the building predates even the founding of Hanszen College.
                        Old Section contains a variety of room types from singles to quads, but it has primarily doubles. Most residents use communal hall bathrooms, but some of the suites
                        have a private bathroom. The first floor is also the home of Bryn and Neal Dugre, two of our Resident Associates. The second and third floor boast interior hallways
                        where the majority of old section rooms can be found. If you keep going up to the fourth floor, you'll find an area called the Weenie Loft, which houses both a
                        TV/movie room and a study room. Old section also has a five story tower with an attached sundeck.

                        During the construction of New Section, part of Hanszen lives in Sid Richardson College's old building. The tower is seven split-level stories, each with an upper and a lower floor.
                        Most rooms are suites of four students with a private bathroom. Nick Bourgeois and Lebena Varghese, two of our Resident Associates, live on the second floor,
                        and our Resident Faculty Associates Lam and Rebecca Yu live on the fifth floor.

                    <p class="text-justify">New Section is Hanszen's newest building, completed in 2023. It stands on the former grounds of the original New Section, which lasted from 1957-2021.
                        New Section is 5 stories tall with single and double rooms. Singles share a hall bathroom in groups of 2-3 rooms, and doubles have private bathrooms. The building hosts a lobby,
                        two RA suites, and three terraces overlooking Hanszen quad. New Section's primary structure is made of mass timber, a stronger, lighter, more sustainable option to concrete.
                        It is the largest residential mass timber building in Texas! The building also incorporates the iconic framed crests and colored tiles from the exterior of the original New Section.

                        Officially called the "1957 Wing" after the year it was built (the same year Hanszen College was founded), "Old" New Section was the home of Hanszenites for more than 60 years.
                        Composed of suites of 3-5 students, the building was known for its quirky architecture, spacious rooms, and structural problems in its later years. The building hosted a laundry room,
                        a sundeck (called the moondeck to avoid confusion with the Old Section sundeck), and the legendary and sentimental B&P. The B&P (Breadsticks and Pomegranates) was a social space where
                        all sorts of events would occur. Due to said problems, a lack of accessibility, and not having enough beds to house Hanszen's growing population, New Section was torn down in 2021.
